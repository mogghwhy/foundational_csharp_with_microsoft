# Evaluate Boolean expressions to make decisions in C#

Learn the operators and techniques required to evaluate and compare values in your decision statements.

## Learning objectives
After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Use operators to create Boolean expressions that test for comparison and equality
- Use built-in methods to the string class to perform better evaluations on strings
- Use the negation operator to test for the opposite of a given condition
- Use the conditional operator to perform an inline evaluation

## Prerequisites
- Experience creating simple C# applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes such as String and Random
- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that implement arrays, if-elseif-else statements, and foreach statements
