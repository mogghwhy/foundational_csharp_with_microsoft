# Create readable code with conventions, whitespace, and comments in C#

Write code that is easier to read, update and support using naming conventions, comments and whitespace.

Learning objectives
In this module, you will:

- Choose descriptive names for variables that describe their purpose and intent.
- Use code comments to temporarily instruct the compiler to ignore lines of code.
- Use code comments to describe higher-level requirements or purpose for a passage of code.
- Write code that effectively uses whitespace to convey the relationship of lines of code.
